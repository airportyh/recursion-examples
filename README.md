# Recursion

These example explore recursive structures and recursive functions
using TypeScript. TypeScript gives us the ability to define recursive
structures in the type definitions, and recursive structures are a great
fit for recursive procedures and act as a guide to building them.

## Examples / Problems

Each `.ts` file contains an example of a recursive structure
and one or more problems that require operating on that recursive
structure.

Read through each example and work through the problems to get the
most benefit out of this.
